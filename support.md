# Support & FAQ

Welcome to the **Eyeland – Keep Blinking** support page.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: The eyes stopped blinking. What should I do?
- Make sure Live Activity is allowed in Settings > Eyeland.
- Ensure notifications are enabled.
- Reopen the app to resume the session.

### Q: How does the app know when I'm tired?
We estimate eye fatigue based on your continuous phone use. After 20–30 minutes of uninterrupted use, the eyes may turn red as a gentle reminder.

### Q: Is my personal data tracked?
No. All animation and timers run locally, and no personal data is collected.

### Q: Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes. Open the App Store, tap your profile > Subscriptions, and manage your Eyeland subscription there.
